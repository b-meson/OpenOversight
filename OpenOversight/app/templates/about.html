<h1>About OpenOversight</h1>
<p>OpenOversight is an accountability platform for helping the public identify police officers for the purpose of filing complaints. We rely on crowdsourced and public data to build a database of police officers in a city, allowing the public to filter through the dataset to find the name and badge number of the offending officer.</p>

<p>Facts and Figures about Chicago Police Department:</p>
<ul>
  <li>State law requires that any person making an allegation of misconduct against a Chicago Police Officer sign a sworn affidavit that certifies that the allegation is true and correct. If the person making the complaint did not actually witness the alleged conduct, they must certify that they believe that the facts in the allegation are true. Illinois law (50 ILCS 725/3.8) requires that anyone filing a complaint against a sworn peace officer must have the complaint supported by a sworn affidavit. Any person who knowingly files a false complaint may be subject to criminal charges or a civil suit. A person commits perjury when, under oath or affirmation, in a proceeding or in any other matter where by law such oath or affirmation is required, he makes a false statement, material to the issue or point in question, which he does not believe to be true. Perjury is a Class 3 felony.  <a href="http://home.chicagopolice.org/inside-the-cpd/internal-affairs-division/the-complaint/">Source: Chicago Police Department</a></li>
   <li>Less than 2% of the 28,567 complaints filed against the Chicago police department from March 2011 to September 2015 resulted in discipline. Most officers who do face discipline are suspended for a week or less.  <a href="http://cpdb.co/data/D1zdwL/citizens-police-data-project">Source: Citizens Police Data Project</a></li>
   <li>Chicago spent over $500 million from 2004 to 2014 on settlements, legal fees and other costs related to complaints against police officers.  <a hreg="http://www.bettergov.org/news/beyond-burge">Source: Better Government Association</a></li>

<p>Facts and Figures about OpenOversight</p>
<p><i>Number of images we’ve collected:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>8,319 images collected from Twitter</li>
  <li>2717 images from Flickr</li>
  <li>245 from submissions from the public (e.g. activist groups in Chicago)</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Total number of tags we’ve collected:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>132 tags - about 1% of the department</li>
</ul>

<p>To review, an image is one that we have collected or have been given that may contain police officers - it could contain many police officers. A “tag” is what we call when a volunteer looks at that image, can read the badge number(s) or name(s) in that image and and thus can associate an officer in the database (name and badge number) with a face in the image. There may be many tags for a given image if there are many officers in the image. </p>
