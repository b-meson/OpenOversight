<h1>About OpenOversight</h1>
<p>OpenOversight is an accountability platform for helping the public identify police officers for the purpose of filing complaints. We rely on crowdsourced and public data to build a database of police officers in a city, allowing the public to filter through the dataset to find the name and badge number of the offending officer.</p>

<p>Facts and Figures about Chicago Police Department:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To file a police complaint in Chicago, a member of the public needs to know as much <a href="http://ipraportal.iprachicago.org/pls/htmldb/f?p=1503:12:5406784243929236">detailed data</a> about the officer as possible. Based on complaints data from the <a href="http://invisible.institute/">Invisible Institute</a>, from March 2011 - March 2015, 28% of complaints (4,000 total complaints) were immediately dropped due to no officer identification.  <a href="http://cpdp.co/data/D8or5A/only-20525-28595-have-id-for-the-accused-officer">Source: Citizen Police Data Project</a></li>
  <li>• All complaints against officers must be supported by a sworn affidavit. False complaints can result in perjury charges, a Class 3 felony.  <a href="http://home.chicagopolice.org/inside-the-cpd/internal-affairs-division/the-complaint/">Source: Chicago Police</a></li>
   <li>Less than 2% of the 28,567 complaints filed against the Chicago police department from March 2011 to September 2015 resulted in discipline. Most officers who do face discipline are suspended for a week or less.  <a href="http://cpdb.co/data/D1zdwL/citizens-police-data-project">Source: Citizens Police Data Project</a></li>
   <li>Chicago spent over $500 million from 2004 to 2014 on settlements, legal fees and other costs related to complaints against police officers.  <a href="http://www.bettergov.org/news/beyond-burge">Source: Better Government Association</a></li>

<p>Facts and Figures about OpenOversight</p>
<p><i>Number of images we’ve collected:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>8,319 images collected from Twitter</li>
  <li>2717 images from Flickr</li>
  <li>245 from submissions from the public (e.g. activist groups in Chicago)</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Total number of tags we’ve collected:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>132 tags - about 1% of the department</li>
</ul>

<p>To review, an image is one that we have collected or have been given that may contain police officers - it could contain many police officers. A “tag” is what we call when a volunteer looks at that image, can read the badge number(s) or name(s) in that image and and thus can associate an officer in the database (name and badge number) with a face in the image. There may be many tags for a given image if there are many officers in the image. </p>
